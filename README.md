## What we are looking for:

**CSS Skills:** Create your own CSS or style object for UI (don't use a UI library like Bootstrap or ant design)

**Code Design:** We are keen to understand how you design and structure your code

**Tests:** We value unit testing. Tests for your components will be a bonus

**Responsive UI** We would love to see how the app works on different screen sizes

**Simplicity:** We value simplicity as an architectural virtue. Your solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and should not be overly complex. Layers of abstraction, patterns, or architectural features that aren't called for should not be included.
